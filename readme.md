This repository provides code for our manuscript "Sources of gain: Decomposing performance in conditional average dose response estimation".  

In our manuscript, we evaluate the impacts of different data-generating processes on data-driven methodologies for conditional average dose response (CADR) estimation. We provide source code to reproduce our experiments, including data generators, performance evaluators, and learning methods.


## Repository structure

This repository is structured as follows:

```bash
src-of-gain/

        |- data/            # Data generators
        |- methods/         # Treatment effect estimators
        |- utils/           # Performance evaluation and other utils
    |- scripts/           # Executables
        |- exp/             # Reproduce experiments
        |- figures/         # Reproduce figures
        |- tables/          # Reproduce tables
    |- data/              # Data files
    |- config/            # Paramters for data loading and hyperparameter tuning
```

For reproducing experiments on TCGA datasets, download the necessary covariate matrices from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VNEZn_aeNzxPfMB9uf2P4ofYJdF9U90N/view?usp=sharing) and save the ```data/``` folder to the repository.


## Installation

All code provided was written for ```python 3.9.16```. To execute the code, please install the necessary packages to a newly created virtual environment by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install .
```

## Running experiments

All executables are in the ```scripts/``` folder. To execute them, simply run:

```bash
python scripts/[folder]/[script]
```

All results (performance metrics and plots) are saved to dedicated folders in the repository during execution.
